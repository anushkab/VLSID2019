Such failures usually manifest as drops in control loop execution leading to unavailability of fresh control signals. In the existing literature, there is an absence of analytical methods which can compute the required patterns of control execution such that the performance of associated control loops remain satisfactory in the presence of such platform level timing uncertainties. We consider such platform level uncertainties as a collection of window based (m, k)-firm specifications and synthesize an (m, k)-firm based input specification for the execution patterns of the loops, so that performance can be provably ensured.

							"abstract": "With the advancement in CMOS technology and multiple processors on the chip, communication across these cores is managed by a Network on Chip (NoC). Power and performance of these NoC interconnect have become a significant factor. In particular, the buffers used at every port consume considerable dynamic as well as leakage power. This paper attempts to reduce leakage power consumption of NoC buffers by use of non-volatile memory (NVM) technology based STT-RAM buffers. STT-RAM technology has the advantage of high density and low leakage but suffers from high write energy and low endurance. In particular, if some buffers get written more number of times compared to some other buffers, the heavily written buffers may wear out faster compared to others. This has an impact on the lifetime of the router as a whole. Here we propose a virtual channel (VC) allocation policy that helps to uniformly distribute the writes across the buffers to improve their effective lifetime. Pure STT-RAM buffers, however, impact the network latency. In order to mitigate this, we propose a hybrid policy that uses an alternative VC made of SRAM technology in case of heavy network traffic. Experimental evaluation on full system simulation shows that the proposed policy reduces the write variation by 99% and improves lifetime by 3.4 times and 24 times, respectively for both the proposals. We also get respectively 93% and 90% gains in the EDP.",

							"abstract": "Prefetching aids in reducing the increasing processor-memory latency gap in a multiprocessor system. In a Tiled Chip MultiProcessor system (TCMP), the cache block reuse pattern of applications vary across the cores. Applications that have a working set larger than the L1 cache size cannot be accommodated in the limited L1 cache space. Such applications suffer from cache space constraints. Prefetching cache blocks of heavy application may cause thrashing by evicting useful cache lines from L1 cache thereby demanding frequent cache block replacements. On the other hand, light applications due to less cache block demands may under-utilize the available L1 cache space. This paper proposes Near Vicinity Prefetching (NVP) where some prefetch blocks are placed in the L1 caches of adjacent tiles running light applications. The prefetching framework works simultaneously with other L1 caches in different tiles to reduce the cache block access time. During cache hits in the neighboring L1 cache, the network transaction required to bring that block reduces from an average of 'n' hops to just one. NVP helps in better cache space utilization and reduced network transactions at minimal hardware. Experimental analysis on a 64-core TCMP with SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark mixes shows that the average memory access time is reduced by 4.42% using the proposed NVP technique.",

The new approach requires no hardware addition or modification to the design. A standard IC tester can be used to measure IDDQ and identify these recycled parts. Our simulation results show that we can detect recycled ICs that have been used for as little as six months.",

In this paper, an advancement SBST technique, termed as Rapid SBST (RSBST) is proposed that reduces the overall test synthesis time by reusing the simulation responses of existing test programs of identical observability. The test codes, developed using the evolutionary process, that produce similar fault simulation results are reused for the fault evaluation.

The test pattern generation time is 90 hours and 98 hours for these two processors, respectively. For the similar processors, traditional SBST requires 122 hours and 142 hours, respectively while providing a coverage of 93.9% and 92.9%.

We show that the proposed techniques provide high image quality even at low power and low area budget of 0.3 uW/pixel and 5.2 um^2/pixel at 0.5 V and 20 MHz in UMC 28nm. The proposed memory architecture is compared with existing heterogeneous 6T, hybrid 8T/6T, all-identical 6T, and all-identical 8T SRAM memory. The results show that proposed memory architectures perform cumulatively better than existing techniques in terms of dynamic power, leakage power & area. The use of proposed memory for storage of an image has much higher Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) than existing SRAM techniques. The results are verified by Spice simulation performed in UMC 28 nm CMOS technology.",

Since these applications are safety-critical, addressing security concerns is vital for the success and adoption of FPVAs. This study evaluates the security of FPVA biochips. We show that FPVAs are vulnerable to malicious operations similar to digital and flow-based microfluidic biochips. FPVAs are further prone to new classes of attacks - tunneling and deliberate aging. The study establishes security metrics and describes possible attacks on real-life bioassays.",

A low power temperature independent biasing circuit is designed to enhance the performance meeting the frequency variations. The architecture includes usage of trim bits to shift the frequency at different process corners. Since the oscillator will run on a battery supply, variations in the performance of the oscillator across supply have been compromised.

A low power temperature independent biasing circuit is designed to enhance the performance meeting the frequency variations. The architecture includes usage of trim bits to shift the frequency at different process corners.

However, they lack in reliability metric. We present a novel approach for improving the uniqueness as well as the reliability of field programmable gated arrays (FPGAs) based ring oscillator PUF and derive a random number, consuming a very small area concerning look up tables (LUTs). We use profiling method for observing frequency variations in ring oscillators (RO), spatially placed across the FPGA floor, and are able to spot the suitable locations for RO mapping, which leads to enhanced ROPUF reliability. We have implemented proposed methodology on Xilinx -7 series FPGAs and tested the robustness against environmental variations e.g. temperature and supply voltage variations. The proposed approach achieves 6% higher uniqueness of 49.83% along with the reliability of 99.35%, which as a group of PUF characteristics, is a significant improvement as compared to characteristics provided by existing ROPUF methods.

Mandal Cognitive Computing Group, CEERI Pilani atanu@ceeri.ernet.in Hardware Security PUF Ring Oscillator FPGA Random Number Generator Biased Placement NIST Statistical Test The physical unclonable functions (PUF) have widely been used to provide software as well as hardware security for the cyber-physical systems. They are used for performing significant cryptography tasks such as generating keys, device authentication and securing against IP piracy. They have also been used to produce the root of trust. However, they lack in reliability metric. We present a novel approach for improving the uniqueness as well as the reliability of field programmable gated arrays (FPGAs) based ring oscillator PUF and derive a random number, consuming a very small area concerning look up tables (LUTs). We use profiling method for observing frequency variations in ring oscillators (RO), spatially placed across the FPGA floor, and are able to spot the suitable locations for RO mapping, which leads to enhanced ROPUF reliability. We have implemented proposed methodology on Xilinx -7 series FPGAs and tested the robustness against environmental variations e.g. temperature and supply voltage variations. The proposed approach achieves 6% higher uniqueness of 49.83% along with the reliability of 99.35%, which as a group of PUF characteristics, is a significant improvement as compared to characteristics provided by existing ROPUF methods. The random number generator so realized passes all applicable nine tests of NIST uniformity statistical test suite.",

							"abstract": "Abstract\u2014Today's rapid progress in the physical implementation of quantum computers demands scalable synthesis methods to map practical logic designs to quantum architectures. There exist many quantum algorithms which use classical functions with superposition of states. Motivated by recent trends, in this paper, we show the design of quantum circuit to perform modular exponentiation functions using two different approaches. In the design phase, first we generate quantum circuit from a verilog implementation of exponentiation functions using synthesis tools and then apply two different Quantum Error Correction techniques. Finally the circuit is further optimized using the Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) Property. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by generating a set of networks for the reversible modular exponentiation function for a set of input values.

There exist many quantum algorithms which use classical functions with superposition of states. Motivated by recent trends, in this paper, we show the design of quantum circuit to perform modular exponentiation functions using two different approaches. In the design phase, first we generate quantum circuit from a verilog implementation of exponentiation functions using synthesis tools and then apply two different Quantum Error Correction techniques. Finally the circuit is further optimized using the Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) Property. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by generating a set of networks for the reversible modular exponentiation function for a set of input values. At the end of the work, we have summarized the obtained results, where a cost analysis over our developed approaches has been made. Experimental results show that depending on the choice of different QECC methods the performance figures can vary by up to 11%, 10%, 8% in T-count, number of qubits, number of gates respectively.",

Based on the pattern, a pre-defined clock-gating is applied to shift the EMD noise frequency from 848KHz to 3.39MHzThe mixed-signal simulation shows 4mV peak EMD noise reduced to 1mV with the solution and the same has been confirmed by silicon validation. The clock-gating impacts the command processing time, which is increased at low field strengths.",

We could achieve the functional Vmin of SRAM to 0.8V using a Repeated-Pulse Wordline Suppression (RPWS) scheme. We could achieve a performance of 40MHz at 0.8V for a 512Kb capacity SRAM with 16K words of 32 bits width. Area and dynamic power overhead for the implementation is within 1% each when compared to a conventional WLUD scheme. Absolute area overhead of the scheme is 2% for the chosen instance.",
